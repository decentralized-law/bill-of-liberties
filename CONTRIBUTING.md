## How to Contribute

### Official Translations

To make these universal liberties widely accessible we would like to see official translations of the Decentralized Bill of Liberties into different languages. However, great care was placed in selecting and drafting the list of liberties. Therefore, to be considered for an offical translation, and become part of immutable legal history, follow the Translation Guidelines.

**Important Translation Guidelines:**
- Translate the official version without additions of subtractions (basing your translation on [this PDF] is probably easiest).
- Maintain the same structure, order, and article numbering as the original.
- It most be published on a blockchain and as PDF.
- The PDf version must be published with your (organizations) name, location, date and opensource license.
- Verify terminology with legal and human rights experts if needed (we reserve the right to verify the translation).
- Translations from experts or official organizations will see priority acceptance.

#### To contribute a translation:

1. **Fork** this repository by clicking the "Fork" button at the top right of this page
2. **Create a new branch** for your translation (e.g., `translation-spanish`)
3. **Create the following files** in the `translations/[LANGUAGE]` folder:
   - HTML file: `BillOfLiberties-[LANGUAGE].html` - modify the provided `BillOfLibertiesFrontEnd.html` file with the address of your smart contract.
   - PDF file: Your official PDF version with your name/organization, location, date, time, and open-source license (CC0 1.0)
   - Contract info: A markdown file with your blockchain deployment details (contract address and network)
4. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description of your translation and verification information
5. If your translation meets our guidelines, we'll add you to the authors list on the main page

## Review Process

Translations might undergo a verification process which may involve community review or input from native speakers.

## Code of Conduct

- **Focus**: Keep contributions relevant to the project's goals
- **Transparency**: Clearly communicate your intentions and reasoning
