# Decentralized Bill of Liberties

PREAMBLE:

Whereas all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights and are endowed with reason and conscience, they should act toward one another in a spirit of brotherhood,

Considering that the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice, and peace in the world,

Recognizing that modern technology unites humanity across borders,

Observing that cross-border technology and governance both pose opportunities and challenges to individual freedoms to act,

Acknowledging that liberties, as fundamental rights, protect individual freedoms to act,

Affirming that liberties limit all forms of human governance and create a universal duty of respect for all persons and institutions—without granting authority to create obligations beyond their original scope,

Realizing the need for a bill of liberties that transcends jurisdictional limitations while applying equally to all,


### CREATING AN IMMUTABLE RECORD OF THE FOLLOWING UNIVERSAL LIBERTIES:

#### Article 1
Every human being has the right to life, liberty, and the security of person, to bodily integrity, and to freedom from medical and scientific procedures without consent.

#### Article 2
Every human being has the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion and to participate in cultural life, arts, and technological and scientific advancement.

#### Article 3
All human beings must be secure in their family, home, and correspondence; be free from attacks upon their honor and reputation; and have the right to privacy.

#### Article 4
All human beings are free to enjoy their own culture, to profess and practice their own religion, and to use their preferred language. All men and women are free and protected in founding and raising a family.

#### Article 5
Every human being has the right to freedom of opinion and expression and to freely obtain and share information regardless of medium.

#### Article 6
Every human being has the right to work and engage in economic activity; to acquire, own, use, and exchange property; and to transact freely in a medium of exchange of choice.

#### Article 7
Every human being has the right to assembly and association and to organize with others to pursue and protect their mutual interests.

#### Article 8
Every human being has the right to freedom of movement and residence.

#### Article 9
Every human being has the right to self-determination, to dignity, to pursue education, and to the free development of personality.

#### Article 10
No human being may be subjected to slavery or servitude, to torture, to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment, or to sexual violence or exploitation.


### REQUIREMENTS OF ALL LEGAL SYSTEMS:

All human beings have a right to a legal order where they are treated as equals before the law, enjoy equal protection from rights violations and arbitrary arrest or detention, and have an effective remedy against rights violations.

No one may be deprived of any liberty except on such grounds and in accordance with such procedures as established by law, and no one may be held guilty of any penal offense which did not constitute a penal offense at the time when it was committed.

Everyone charged with a penal offense has the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty; be entitled to a fair and public hearing by a competent, independent, and impartial judiciary system; and, when deprived of their liberty, be treated with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person.

## About This Project

This project permanently stores the Decentralized Bill of Liberties on the Ethereum blockchain and provides easy-to-use tools for displaying it on any website. The purpose is to create an immutable record of these universal liberties that transcends jurisdictional limitations.

### Key Features

**Immutable Storage**: The Bill of Liberties is permanently recorded on the Ethereum blockchain  
**Universal Access**: Anyone can access and display this document through the blockchain  
**Easy Integration**: Simple HTML/JavaScript snippet for adding to any website  
**Transparent**: Open-source code and documentation for all components

### About This Initiative

This project is a first initiative to publish law on blockchain. It aims to demonstrate that decentralized blockchains can serve humanity in other ways than just with transactions. It invites you to think of new ways of law creation outside existing jurisdictions. While this initial example is a static on-chain publication, future decentralized law-making will make use of an off-chain body of law accepted and amended by the same voting techniques known to other crypto projects.

### Why Do We Need This Bill of Liberties?

The Decentralized Bill of Liberties addresses a critical gap in our legal frameworks. Despite the widespread acceptance of human rights principles, modern legal systems were designed for centralized structures and struggle to accommodate decentralized technologies. As threats to liberty evolve beyond nation-states to include international institutions, debt-based financial systems, NGOs, and cross-border technology, we need a bill of rights that protects all humans equally while existing independently of institutions—one that is not a codification of ideology, does not treat individuals as means to an end, and exists separately from (supra)national governing layers.

The Decentralized Bill of Liberties can be implemented in various contexts. It can serve as a moral compass for participants in decentralized networks to assess behavior, regulations, and technologies. When establishing social smart contracts—whether DAOs, network states, or other Decentralized Law instruments—entities can "call" the DBoL during the creation process. Because it is uploaded to the blockchain it can serve as an objective legal standard for both blockchain projects and AI, similar to how smart contract software calls libraries of code. The DBoL can also inspire citizens of countries that currently do not have a bill of rights and function as a "prenuptial agreement" to any kind of social contract, establishing clear boundaries between collective rule and individual liberty.

## Getting Started

### Display the Bill of Liberties on Your Website

You can easily display the Bill of Liberties on your website by adding a simple HTML/JavaScript snippet that fetches the content directly from the Ethereum blockchain.

The repository includes a ready-to-use implementation file at [frontend/BillOfLibertiesFrontEnd.html](frontend/BillOfLibertiesFrontEnd.html) that you can download and adapt to your needs.

The implementation:
- Loads the content directly from the Ethereum blockchain
- Provides customizable styling options
- Handles error cases gracefully
- Includes caching for better performance

See the [Integration Guide](./docs/INTEGRATION.md) for detailed instructions on adding this to your website.

### Create Your Own Immutable Laws on the Ethereum Blockchain

You can create your own immutable legal texts or declarations on the Ethereum blockchain using the smart contract provided in this repository:

- The [DecentralizedBillOfLiberties.sol](contracts/DecentralizedBillOfLiberties.sol) contract serves as a template
- Simple design allows for permanent storage of any text on the blockchain
- Deploy with your own text to create an immutable record
- Once deployed, the content cannot be altered - ensuring permanence
- Pair with the frontend code to make your text easily accessible

This approach can be used for constitutions, declarations, principles, or any text that benefits from immutable, decentralized storage. The contract is intentionally minimal to ensure reliability and reduce deployment costs.

For detailed deployment instructions, see the [Deployment Guide](./docs/DEPLOYMENT.md).

### Technical Details

- **Smart Contract**: The Bill of Liberties is stored in a simple Solidity smart contract deployed on the Ethereum Mainnet
- **Frontend Integration**: A lightweight JavaScript snippet using ethers.js to fetch and display the text
- **Customization**: Change the styling variables to match your website's design

For more detailed technical information, see the [Deployment Documentation](./docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) and [Integration Guide](./docs/INTEGRATION.md).

## Coming Soon

A comprehensive chapter on the theory of rights and the rational basis for these specific liberties will be added in the coming weeks. This additional documentation will provide philosophical context and explore the implications of these liberties in the digital age. It is one chapter of the book on Decentralized Law, which envisions a future legal system that is more decentralized.
